## Context and Problem Statement

VIVE Pro 2 and VIVE Wireless is runs VRChat with pixelation with default settings.

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Force VRCHat to be not fullscreen and reduce the computer's CPU usage so that the wireless encoding can not overwhelm single core cpu.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Launch VRChat with vrchat `-screen-width 1280 -screen-height 720 -screen-fullscreen 0`

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- VIVE Wireless is amazing.

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Confusing setup.

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: Return VIVE Pro 2 and return VIVE Wireless
- Rejection Reason: Wireless desktop with Lighthouses is amazing and would be shame to ignore it.

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Not code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

Need to do this because it's my hardware.
